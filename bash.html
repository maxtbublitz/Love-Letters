		<h1>Dear Bash,</h1>
		</header>
		<p>I love when we explore together. We can <b>cd</b> into any directory we want, and once we're there, you show me the way with your <b>ls</b> command, which lists all of the directories contents. We can even make our own directories together ;) using <b>mkdir</b>. If I'm ever lost you help me find myself with the <b>pwd</b> command.</p>
		<p>Your touch is what really makes the magic happen. If I <b>touch</b> a file that doesn't yet exist you will create it for me. From there I can <b>nano</b> into that file and edit it from your elegantly simple interface. There's nothing we can't do together.</p>
		<p>You always have the answer. If I don't understand how to use a command I can type <b>man</b> and you will pull up a manual on how to use it. You really take the strain off of my fingers by auto-completing what I'm typing when I use the <b>tab</b> key and the <b>control + a</b> and <b>control + e</b> shortcuts which take me to the start or end of a line.</p>
		<p>Your <b>ditto</b> command lets me copy a file into a different directory. Normally I hate playing games but they're fun with you, all I have to do is type <b>Fn+F10</b> followed by <b>t</b> and <b>g</b>.</p>
