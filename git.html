	<h1>Dear git,</h1>

	<p>All I have to do to be with you is type a simple <b>git init</b>. And although I may not see you in my current dirrectory, I know you're there for me, but I can always check by using the -ls a command. Relationships can be so complicated but you make it so simple with your honest <b>git status</b>. If I've fallen behind, you remind me that I have to <b>get add .</b> by appearing red, and if you're green I don't have to do anything, because once again you've already saved me.</p> 
	<p>When we make an espicially extrodinary file together you give me the option to <b>git commit</b> so we can cherish the memory of the file forever, and so I can go back to the file at the current stage I commit it if I later corrupt the file by manipulating it. This is made possible by your <b>git checkout</b> command. I can also do a <b>git stash</b>, where you save all my cahnges in a seperate file.</p>
	<p>I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me. Lets git together again soon,</p>
	<p>		Max</p>
