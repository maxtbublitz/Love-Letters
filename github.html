		<h1>Dear Github,</h1>
		<p>With you, I can store my versions online and colaborate with people on the same project. You're not a gold digger, you make it so easy to be with you with your option for a free membership. Once I made my account at <b><a href="https://github.com" >https://github.com</a></b> I knew we were a perfect match.</p> 
		<p>To create a new project I create a new repository on your beuatiful webiste. I always make sure to check the public option so everyone can see the amazing projects we make together. To publish my work I use terminal and type <b>git remote add orgin</b> and copy and paste the URL. I follow that with a <b>git push -u orgin master</b> to make it official.</p>
		<p>I can make changes to my projects through GIT and you follow the changes I make. You're so understanding are you're always right there with me once I've set up a repository. Thank you for everything,</p>
		<p>Max</p>
